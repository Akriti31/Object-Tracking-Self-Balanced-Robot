<h4>
SELF BALANCING:
</h4>
<br>
The basics behind a balancing robot is based on the Inverted Pendulum concept. The goal is to have a control algorithm called Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) to keep the robot balanced by trying to keep the wheels under the center of gravity. Eg. If the robot leans forwards, the wheels spin forward trying correct the lean.

Image Processing has been the talk of e-world for some years. Its varied applications have found its uses in almost every field.In Electrical Engineering and ComputerScience, image processing is any form of signal processing for which the input is an image, such as photographs or frames of video; the output of image processing can be either an image or a set of characteristics or parametersrelated to the image. Most image- processing techniques involve treating the image as a two-dimensionalsignaland applying standard signal- processing techniques to it.
